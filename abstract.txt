Biological researchers often employ networks to describe relationships between an organism's genes at-scale in a biological context. However, networks can also describe how genes interact in literature. In this project, I created interactive gene literature networks that describe how often genes are mentioned in the same peer-reviewed academic article. The example files generated here include gene literature networks including the 100 most popular genes (i.e. most publications from 2000-2018), the 200 most popular genes, and all cancer-related genes (as annotated in the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census).
